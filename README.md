### Personal Information

- **Name:** Kristin Wolvaardt 
- **Date:** 2024/04/04
- **Current Role/Position:** Full-time Student at CodeSpace Academy 
- **Field of Interest:** My current fields of interest include Software Engineering; Game Development; Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking. I have not yet decided which one I will settle on or if I’ll pursue multiple at once. I’m too early into my study career to make that decision, but I will update this file later on down the line to keep track of my progress and interests.

### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - List your current skills and areas of expertise.

    1. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
    2. HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
    3. Basics in JavaScript
    4. I have some understanding of C (programming language created by Dennis Ritchie) because of a prior online course that I took.
    5. Basic understanding of Binary Code. I learned this from the same course I learned C from.
    
    - Identify skills you need to develop or improve.
    
    1. Time Management. I believe that time management is an essential skill to not only learn, but to master. Not just for this     specific career path. It could apply to every aspect of your life.
    2. Git version control. I've been finding it a bit difficult to navigate around Git and I'd like to improve in that field.
    3. Adaptability. A soft skill that I've been finding to be rather difficult. This course is quite fast paced and I'm struggling to adapt. I've been able to get into a semi-rhythm, but I'm not where I'd like to be. Adaptability goes hand and hand with time management, so it is very important for me to master this skill.
    4. Communication and teamwork. I've been able to work on these since I physically attend campus and I've been able to communicate with a classmate of mine. I'm placing these here because I believe that I will never stop developing Communication and teamwork skills, but it can always be improved.
    5. Programming Proficiency. I'd like to improve my problem solving skills and understanding of of syntax and logic of programming languages.

2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - Describe your key interests related to your career.

    1. Software engineers have a broad perspective when it comes to understanding a project's system and software requirements. They  carefully plan out the scope and sequence of tasks involved. In addition to this, they may also oversee software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers.
    2. When it comes to systems software development, professionals in this field are responsible for creating operating systems, either for the general public or tailored specifically for an organization's needs. These operating systems are crucial for the functioning of computers and control various consumer electronics like cell phones and cars. Moreover, systems software developers often design the interface that enables users to interact with computers effectively.
    3. The gaming industry offers boundless opportunities for those with creative and analytical skills. From crafting immersive worlds to developing engaging narratives and captivating graphics, there's ample room for exploration. If you thrive on creativity, this field provides an ideal platform to express yourself. Whether it's visualizing concepts or executing intricate designs, you can leverage your creativity and analytical abilities, making the field intellectually stimulating.
    4. In cybersecurity, professionals are constantly engaged in dynamic and meaningful work. The landscape of cybercrime and cybersecurity is ever-changing, requiring professionals to stay ahead of evolving threats. Contributing to the protection of individuals' livelihoods and privacy instills a sense of purpose in the work. Moreover, the constant need to remain vigilant and adapt to new challenges ensures that the job remains intellectually stimulating and rewarding.

    - What values are important to you in a work environment?
    
    1. Collaborative
    I believe that as an employee, it's essential to feel empowered to make decisions and take action. While autonomy is crucial, I also recognize the significance of collaboration in achieving career success. Being a strong team player not only helps individuals grow within their company but also fosters overall career advancement.
    2. Growth
    In my view, the growth of a company is intricately linked to the professional development of its employees. Valuing growth means continuously striving for improvement, both personally and organizationally. This mutual success-oriented approach underscores the importance of seeking out companies that prioritize staff development and offer environments conducive to personal and professional growth.
    3. Balance
    Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is paramount for employee well-being. It involves effectively managing professional and personal responsibilities to ensure high performance while allowing sufficient time for rest and leisure. A balanced approach not only enhances engagement, productivity, and retention but also contributes to overall happiness and fulfillment.
    4. Time Management
    I believe that mastering time management is a critical skill for professional success. Organizing tasks, prioritizing projects, and effectively communicating progress are essential components of efficient time management. By honing these skills, individuals can achieve their goals, demonstrate reliability, and advance in their careers.
    5. Creativity and Design Thinking
    In my experience, creativity plays a pivotal role in business success, but it thrives best within a structured framework. This is where design thinking becomes invaluable.
    Design thinking, a methodology gaining traction in the business world, offers a structured approach to problem-solving that bridges the gap between abstract creativity and practical solutions. Embracing creativity and innovation within the design thinking process can lead to breakthrough solutions and drive organizational growth.
